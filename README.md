# ChessVision
Chess Vision software designed to help increase fluency in chess notation. This project is intended to be a local version of [Chess.com's vision practice tool](https://www.chess.com/vision) with more customizations such as time control and the ability to review mistakes.

As of 06/28/2023 run ChessBoard.py to run the program

As of 07/02/2023, ChessVision has an interface to select different squares and lets them know if they selected the right square or not, by highlighting the correct and incorrect squares
